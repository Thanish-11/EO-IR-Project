# EO-IR-Project
The EO/IR (Electro-Optical / Infrared) Project is a real-time vision-based surveillance and tracking system designed to capture, detect, and track targets using both visible (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors. This system is useful in applications such as defense, border security, drone vision, search and rescue, and wildlife monitoring.
